# DeafBlind Manual Blog Website

## Description

I created the DeafBlind Manual Blog Website to promote awareness and provide resources for the DeafBlind community. The project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on accessibility. The website includes a responsive design, a JavaScript-based hamburger menu for mobile devices, and utilizes CSS Grid for layout. Additionally, it features embedded YouTube videos, a customized scrollbar, and a "Go to Top" button for improved user experience.
